### Step 1: Create a Figma Account 📝

Before you can register an application, you need to have a **Figma account**. If you don't have one, you can create it at the Figma website.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Developer Settings 🚀

In your Figma account settings, navigate to the **Developer Settings** section[^1^][1].

### Step 3: Register a New Plugin 🆕

Click on **New Plugin** and provide the necessary details about your plugin[^1^][1].

### Step 4: Configure Your OAuth Consent Screen ⚙️

You'll need to configure your OAuth consent screen:
- **Application name**: This is the name users will see.
- **User support email**: The email displayed on the consent screen.
- **Authorized domains**: Your application's domain.
- **Application Homepage link**: The home page of your app[^1^][1].

After filling in these details, click on the **Save** button[^1^][1].

### Step 5: Get Your Client ID and Client Secret 🔑

After your plugin is registered, Figma will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Make sure to note these down as they will be used in your application's code[^1^][1].

### Step 6: Set Authorized Redirect URIs 🌐

In the same plugin settings page, set your **Authorized redirect URIs**. This is the URI where users will be redirected after they authenticate with Figma[^1^][1].
