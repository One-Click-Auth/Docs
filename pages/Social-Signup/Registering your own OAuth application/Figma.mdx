### Step 1: Create a Discord Developer Application 📝

Before you can register an application, you need to have a **Discord Developer Application**. If you don't have one, you can create it at the Discord Developer Portal.

### Step 2: Navigate to the OAuth2 Page 🚀

In your application's settings, click on the **OAuth2** link on the left sidebar[^1^][1].

### Step 3: Add a Redirect URL 🌐

Click on **Add Redirect** and add the URL where you want Discord to redirect users after they authorize your application. This is typically your application's URL[^1^][1].

### Step 4: Generate an OAuth2 URL 🔗

Lower down on the page, you can find an **OAuth2 URL Generator** provided by Discord. Use this to create a URL for yourself with the necessary scopes[^1^][1].

### Step 5: Get Your Client ID and Client Secret 🔑

Take note of the **client id** and **client secret** fields. Copy these values as they will be used in your application's code[^1^][1].

### Step 6: Implement OAuth2 in Your Application 💻

Now that you have your OAuth2 URL, client ID, and client secret, you can implement OAuth2 in your application. You'll need to use these values to get an access token and refresh token from Discord[^1^][1].
