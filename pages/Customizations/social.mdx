# Customizing Social Sign-On with TrustAuthX 🌐🔑

TrustAuthX allows you to integrate almost any supported social sign-up. We are committed to delivering as many options as possible to fulfill everyone's needs. You can create your own OAuth2 client and use it with TrustAuthX. If you don't want to create your own, don't worry, we've got you covered. You can always use our generic Social Sign-On.
