# Integrating Custom Email Servers with TrustAuthX 📧🔒

In the digital world, email servers are crucial for communication. TrustAuthX's Custom Email Server feature allows you to integrate any email server or provider with TrustAuthX, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your authentication process.

This feature enables developers to use their preferred email servers for sending authentication emails, such as verification links or one-time passwords (OTPs). This not only personalizes your authentication process but also ensures high security standards.
