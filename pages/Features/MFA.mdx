# Implementing TOTP-Based MFA with TrustAuthX 🕒🔑

In the digital world, security is of utmost importance. TrustAuthX's Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) feature allows you to enhance the security of user accounts on your platform.

This feature adds an additional layer of verification by requiring users to provide a time-sensitive, one-time password in addition to their regular credentials. This not only strengthens the security but also ensures a robust authentication process.
