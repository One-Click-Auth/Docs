# Trustauthx React SDK Documentation

## What You Will Learn

- How to Create a Trustauthx Account
- Using the Demo Organization
- Getting Started with the Installation and Initialization of Trustauthx in a
  new React application

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create a Trustauthx Account

[Create a Trustauthx Account ↗](https://app.trustauthx.com/signup) or
[Sign in to your Trustauthx dashboard ↗](https://app.trustauthx.com/).

### Step 2: Use Demo Organization

If you have just created an account for the first time, you will be directed to
your Trustauthx dashboard.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/manage_demo_org.png)
</div>

Following this, you need to generate your API key and Secret key for the 'Demo
Org' organization on your Trustauthx Dashboard before setting up Trustauthx
React.

To generate a new API key and Secret key, click the `Manage` button to navigate
to the Demo Org Dashboard page. Then, click on the `Manage API keys` link.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/manage_demo_api_keys.png)
</div>

Now, click the `Delete existing & generate a new Pair` button to create new API
and Secret keys.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/generate_demo_secrets.png)
</div>

Afterward, copy and paste your organization's API Key, Secret Key, and
Organization Id locally.

### Step 3: Getting Started with Installing and Initializing Trustauthx in a new React application

<Steps>

#### Set Up the React Application using Trustauthx template

// TODO: check if `pkg` is published and update accordingly

#### Install Dependencies

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **npm**: <br /> ```npm i```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **yarn**: <br /> ```yarn install```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Set Environment Keys

<Tabs.Tab> 
```
VITE_ORG_ID=your_org_id
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You are now ready to `run the development server`, `deploy your app`, and
welcome new users!
