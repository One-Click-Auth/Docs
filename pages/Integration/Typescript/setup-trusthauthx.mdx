### Step 1: Create a Trustauthx Account

[Create a Trustauthx Account â†—](https://app.trustauthx.com/signup) or
[Sign in to your Trustauthx dashboard â†—](https://app.trustauthx.com/).

### Step 2: Use Demo Organization

If you have just created an account for the first time, you will be directed to
your Trustauthx dashboard.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/manage_demo_org.png)
</div>

Following this, you need to generate your API key and Secret key for the 'Demo
Org' organization on your Trustauthx Dashboard before setting up Trustauthx
React.

To generate a new API key and Secret key, click the `Manage` button to navigate
to the Demo Org Dashboard page. Then, click on the `Manage API keys` link.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/manage_demo_api_keys.png)
</div>

Now, click the `Delete existing & generate a new Pair` button to create new API
and Secret keys.

<div
  style={{
    filter: 'drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)',
    margin: '16px auto',
  }}
>
  ![An interactive dashboard to customize your "<SignIn />" component according
  to your preferences, allowing you to manage your organization, users, widgets,
  and secrets through various auth providers. ](/generate_demo_secrets.png)
</div>

Afterward, copy and paste your organization's API Key, Secret Key, and
Organization Id locally.
