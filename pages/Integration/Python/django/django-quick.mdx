## Step 1: Install Django 📦

To install Django, you can use the pip command. Pip is a package manager for Python. You can use it to install and manage your Python packages. Here's how you can install Django:

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
pip install django
```

## Step 2: Start a Django Project 🚀

Once Django is installed, you can start a new project using the django-admin command-line utility. Here's the command:

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
django-admin startproject your_project_name
```
Replace `your_project_name` with the name you want to give to your project.

## Step 3: Move to Your Project Directory 📂

After creating the project, you need to navigate to your project directory. You can do this using the cd (change directory) command:

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
cd your_project_name
```
Replace `your_project_name` with the name of your Django project.

## Step 4: Install TrustAuthX 📦

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
pip install trustauthx
```

## Step 5: Login to TrustAuthX 🔑

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
trustauthx login me -k <API_KEY> -s <SECRET_KEY> -o <ORG_ID>
```

## Step 6: Generate a Django Project Structure 🏗️

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
trustauthx neuroform django
```

## Step 7: Copy authx.py File to Your Main App Directory 📋

To copy the authx.py file to your main app directory, you can use the cp (copy) command in Unix or the copy command in Windows. Here's how you can do it:

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
cp path_to_authx.py path_to_your_main_app_directory
```
Replace `path_to_authx.py` with the path where your authx.py file is located, and `path_to_your_main_app_directory` with the path to your main app directory.

## Step 8: Start the Django Project 🎉

```bash copy showLineNumbers filename="bash"
trustauthx start django
```
