# TrustAuthx Pricing 💰

At TrustAuthx, we believe in fair and transparent pricing. Our goal is to help you save almost 50% compared to any other platform. Here's how our pricing works:

## Build Your Own Plan 🛠️

Our pricing is sectioned so that you can build your own plan based on your specific needs. We don't limit Monthly Active Users (MAU) in any plan. Instead, our pricing is based solely on the base Resource and API calls that you've used. This makes our pricing more fair and costs 50% less than any traditional MAU-based pricing plan.

## API Calls 📞

An API call is considered whenever we serve a base authorization request, i.e., whenever a user requests access. All other requests such as token rotation, token revocation, data requests, etc., are free and not counted as API calls.

## Cost per API Call 💵

We've structured our pricing in such a way that it should cost half of popular existing apps with the same functionalities. The expiration time for the refresh token is configured to 7 days (this can be changed but it will affect pricing). So, if a user gets authorized 10 times a week, it will cost approximately $0.01. This is equivalent to having $0.01 per MAU, which is 50% less than clerk.com and 80% less than Auth0.

With TrustAuthx, you get more for less. Start saving today! 💼
