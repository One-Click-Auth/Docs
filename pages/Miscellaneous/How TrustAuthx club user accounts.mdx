# How TrustAuthx Manages User Accounts ðŸ‘¥

At TrustAuthx, we understand that managing user accounts can be a complex task. That's why we've implemented a feature to make this process more efficient and hassle-free.

## Automatic Account Merging ðŸ”„

If you notice a discrepancy between the number of users displayed and the number of users in your "Manage User" panel, don't worry! TrustAuthx automatically merges accounts with the same email address from different users, including social logins, SSO, and others. This means you can manage every account associated with the same email all at once, saving you time and effort.

This feature ensures that all user data is consolidated under one account, providing a streamlined and unified view of each user. So sit back, relax, and let TrustAuthx handle the complexities of user account management for you! ðŸŽ‰
